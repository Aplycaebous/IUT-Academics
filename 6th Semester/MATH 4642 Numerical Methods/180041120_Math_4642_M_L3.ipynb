        "\n",
        "Interpolation is the process of estimating unknown data that lies within the range of some known data. The **Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation** is one of the methods of performing this task. In order to interpolate unknown data, one needs to define a model that would fit the known data and based on that model, one would obtain the unknown data. This model would basically be function that tries to satisfy the known data points. There can be various types of functions that may satisfy the same given data points, but for interpolation, we usually choose **polynomials** as interpolating functions due to the fact that polynomials are very to evaluate, differentiate and integrate.\n",
